# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project predicts **customer churn** (whether a customer will leave a company or not) using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**.  
It was **deployed using Streamlit** for easy real-time predictions.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview
- **Dataset:** Bank customer churn dataset  
- **Goal:** Predict whether a customer will stay or leave  
- **Model Used:** ANN (TensorFlow/Keras)  
- **Preprocessing:** Label encoding, feature scaling, and splitting  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall  

---

## 🚀 Streamlit Deployment
Users can enter customer details such as age, balance, and tenure to get instant churn predictions.  
The app displays:
- Predicted outcome: “Will Leave” / “Will Stay”  
- Model confidence percentage  



---

## 📈 Example Results
| Metric | Value |
|---------|--------|
| Accuracy | ~86% |
| Precision | ~84% |
| Recall | ~80% |

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Learned to build and train ANN models from scratch  
- Understood regularization (Dropout) and optimization (Adam)  
- Deployed predictive models for end-user interaction  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Streamlit**
